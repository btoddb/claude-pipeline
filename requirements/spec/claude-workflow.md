# Claude workflow

## Follow-up issues

1. **constraint CW-1** Every Claude-running phase (`respond`, `plan`,
   `implement`, `revise`, and `review`) may file follow-up GitHub issues with
   `gh issue create` when it discovers work that belongs outside the current
   task.
2. **constraint CW-2** Follow-up issue filing must use the workflow's
   `issues: write` GitHub token.
3. **constraint CW-3** Follow-up issue filing must not relax each phase's
   code-write boundary: `plan`, `review`, and `respond` remain unable to edit
   files or push branches through their Claude tool allow-lists.
4. **constraint CW-4** Phases must call `gh issue create` non-interactively,
   with `--title` and `--body` provided, so GitHub CLI does not prompt or fail
   for missing required input in CI.

## Ship command

1. **constraint CW-5** `@claude ship` runs only on open pull requests. On an
   issue, it posts a notify message directing the user to comment on an open
   pull request instead.
2. **constraint CW-6** By default, ship requires all status checks to be green
   before merging. Failed, cancelled, timed-out, pending, and in-progress checks
   all block the merge, and the blocking comment must name each non-green check.
3. **constraint CW-7** `@claude ship --force` skips the all-green guard and
   attempts the merge anyway.
4. **constraint CW-8** Ship squash-merges the pull request with
   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` and deletes the head branch. The human
   `@claude ship` comment is the approval signal; no separate approval command
   is required.
5. **constraint CW-9** After merging, ship checks out the updated `main` branch
   and runs `scripts/ship` in the repository root.
6. **constraint CW-10** If `scripts/ship` is missing, ship fails with guidance to
   create one from `templates/ship.template`.
7. **constraint CW-11** `scripts/ship` is the per-repository release hook. The
   pipeline's `templates/ship.template` is a reference implementation that
   creates a pre-release by default.
8. **constraint CW-12** Passing `--public-release` to `@claude ship` forwards the
   flag to `scripts/ship`, allowing the repository release hook to create a
   public latest release.
9. **constraint CW-13** `scripts/ship` in `btoddb/claude-pipeline` keeps the
   reusable-workflow release behavior by floating the `v1` major tag. When it
   runs in GitHub Actions, it skips the interactive confirmation prompt
   automatically.
10. **constraint CW-14** On any ship failure, including preflight, merge, and
    release-hook failures, the `report-failure` action tags the maintainer with
    the phase name `Ship`.
