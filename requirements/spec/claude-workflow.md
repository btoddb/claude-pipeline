# Claude workflow

## Follow-up issues

1. **constraint CW-1** Every Claude-running phase (`respond`, `plan`,
   `implement`, `revise`, and `review`) may file follow-up GitHub issues with
   `gh issue create` when it discovers work that belongs outside the current
   task.
2. **constraint CW-2** Follow-up issue filing must use the workflow's
   `issues: write` GitHub token.
3. **constraint CW-3** Follow-up issue filing must not relax each phase's
   code-write boundary: `plan`, `review`, and `respond` remain unable to edit
   files or push branches through their Claude tool allow-lists.
4. **constraint CW-4** Phases must call `gh issue create` non-interactively,
   with `--title` and `--body` provided, so GitHub CLI does not prompt or fail
   for missing required input in CI.

## Ship command

1. **constraint CW-5** `@claude ship` runs only on open pull requests. On an
   issue, it posts a notify message directing the user to comment on an open
   pull request instead.
2. **constraint CW-6** By default, ship requires all status checks to be green
   before merging. Failed, cancelled, timed-out, pending, and in-progress checks
   all block the merge, and the blocking comment must name each non-green check.
3. **constraint CW-7** `@claude ship --force` skips the all-green guard and
   attempts the merge anyway.
4. **constraint CW-8** Ship squash-merges the pull request with
   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` and deletes the head branch. The human
   `@claude ship` comment is the approval signal; no separate approval command
   is required.
5. **constraint CW-9** After merging, ship checks out the updated `main` branch
   and runs `scripts/ship` in the repository root.
6. **constraint CW-10** If `scripts/ship` is missing, ship fails with guidance to
   create one from `templates/ship.template`.
7. **constraint CW-11** `scripts/ship` is the per-repository release hook. The
   pipeline's `templates/ship.template` is a reference implementation that
   creates a pre-release by default.
8. **recommendation CW-12** Client `scripts/ship` implementations should support
   `--public-release`, `--bump-patch`, `--bump-minor`, and `--bump-major`. The
   workflow forwards these flags to `scripts/ship`; `--public-release` creates a
   public latest release, and the bump flags increment the release version by
   patch, minor, and major respectively.
9. **constraint CW-13** `scripts/ship` in `btoddb/claude-pipeline` keeps the
   reusable-workflow release behavior by floating the `v1` major tag. When it
   runs in GitHub Actions, it skips the interactive confirmation prompt
   automatically.
10. **constraint CW-14** On any ship failure, including preflight, merge, and
    release-hook failures, the `report-failure` action tags the maintainer with
    the phase name `Ship`.

## Plan-to-implementation handoff

1. **constraint CW-15** When planning posts a control marker, the marker must
   identify the approved plan comment with `<!-- claude:plan-comment-id:... -->`
   while preserving the existing `<!-- claude:plan -->` and
   `<!-- claude:proceed -->` markers.
2. **constraint CW-16** The implement job must resolve the approved plan comment
   before running Claude. It should prefer the explicit plan-comment id and fall
   back to the latest non-marker, non-`github-actions` comment before the marker
   for older control comments.
3. **constraint CW-17** The implement job must pass the approved plan body to
   Claude as explicit implementation-phase prompt context. Sonnet must execute
   that plan, not rediscover it from issue comments created after the trigger.
   The action must still run in tag/track-progress mode so it creates the normal
   Claude branch and tracking comment.
4. **constraint CW-18** A successful implement job must leave an implementation
   pull request open. If Claude does not open one, the workflow must create it
   from the pushed Claude branch or fail with an explanatory issue comment when
   no branch or no diff exists.
